# Sound-Classification
Implementing of Deep learning Algorithm for Sound Classifcation
Consist of different Deep learning Algorithms for Sound Classificatin
 Dataset is the main folder where data of sound files are stores in sub files <br>
 Data need to store in the sub_dirs with the filder names 1,2,3 etc for easy labeling the data <br>
 If need to classify the data into three different classes then there shoould be three different sub_dirs in the Dataset Directory <br>
 the three sub directories are names as 0,1,2 etc
 
# Packages necessary are <br>
 **librosa** for features calculating from the speech signal <br>
 **numpy** for matrix manuplations <br>
 **matplotlib** for plots <br>
 **Tensorflow** backend deeplearning library <br>
 **Keras**  Deeplearning wrap 
**Python 3** Programming language
